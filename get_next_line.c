 * ** When get_next_line is first called, we check to see if our static variable
 * ** **s is empty. If it is, we allocate memory for it using our buff string.
 * ** In the loop, we will continue to read more of the line and join them together
 * ** using a temporary string. This temporary string will replace the stored data
 * ** each iteration so that we can keep track of how much is read and delete
 * ** the previous stored data. This is needed because we are only reading so many
 * ** n-bytes at a time decided by our BUFFER_SIZE. If we read at each iteration
 * ** without freeing memory, then we would have memory leaks. The loop breaks when
 * ** a newline is encountered. Finally, we call output function to check what
